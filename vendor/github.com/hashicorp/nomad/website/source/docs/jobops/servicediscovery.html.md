# Using Service Discovery

Service discovery is key for applications in a dynamic environment to discover
each other. As such, Nomad has built in support for registering services and
health checks with [Consul](http://consul.io).

For more details on using service discovery with your application, see
the [Service Discovery documentation](/docs/jobspec/servicediscovery.html).
