# Command: stop

The `stop` command is used to stop a running job and signals the scheduler
to cancel all of the running allocations.

## Usage

```
nomad stop [options] <job>
```

The stop command requires a single argument, specifying the job ID or prefix to
cancel. If there is an exact match based on the provided job ID or prefix, then
the job will be cancelled. Otherwise, a list of matching jobs and information
will be displayed.

Upon successful deregistration, an interactive monitor session will start to
display log lines as the job unwinds its allocations and completes shutting
down. The monitor will exit once all allocations are stopped and the job has
reached a terminal state. It is safe to exit the monitor early using ctrl+c.

## General Options

<%= general_options_usage %>

## Stop Options

* `-detach`: Return immediately instead of entering monitor mode. After the
  deregister command is submitted, a new evaluation ID is printed to the screen,
  which can be used to examine the evaluation using the
  [eval-status](/docs/commands/eval-status.html) command.

## Status Options

* `-verbose`: Show full information.

## Examples

Stop the job with ID "job1":

```
$ nomad stop job1
==> Monitoring evaluation "43bfe672"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "43bfe672" finished with status "complete"
```

Stop the job with ID "job1" and return immediately:

```
$ nomad stop -detach job1
