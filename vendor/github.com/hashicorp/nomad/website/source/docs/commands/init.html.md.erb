# Command: init

The `init` command creates an example [job specification](/docs/jobspec/) in the current
directory that demonstrates some common configurations for tasks, task groups,
runtime constraints, and resource allocation.

Please refer to the [jobspec](/docs/jobspec/) and [drivers](/docs/drivers/)
pages to learn how to customize the template.

## Examples

Generate an example job file:

```
$ nomad init
Example job file written to example.nomad
```
